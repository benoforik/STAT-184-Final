# STAT-184-Final
This project explores how NCAA FBS football win rates vary across conferences and what factors, like enrollment size, may be related to team success. Using a Kaggle dataset, two season statistics datasets, and web-scraped NCAA program data, I created visualizations comparing win rates and enrollment across conferences. I found that conferences like the SEC and Big Ten often have higher win rates and larger enrollments, which could contribute to sustained program strength.

The code for this project was written following Hadley Wickham's Tidyverse Style Guide.
